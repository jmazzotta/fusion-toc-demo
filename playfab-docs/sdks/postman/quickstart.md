- To connect to the PlayFab service, your machine must be running TLS v1.2 or better.

- For Windows, this means Windows 7 and above
- [Official Microsoft Documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380516%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
- [Support for SSL/TLS protocols on Windows](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/kaushal/archive/2011/10/02/support-for-ssl-tls-protocols-on-windows.aspx)

## Setup
