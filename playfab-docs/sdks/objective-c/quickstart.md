# Objective-C Quickstart

This guide will help you make your first PlayFab API call using Objective-C by showing you how to get started with our [Objective-C SDK for native OSX & iOS development](https://github.com/PlayFab/Objective_C_SDK)

> [!Note]
> This SDK is currently in Beta, so please let us know if you run into any issues.

Happy Developing!

## Getting started

There are two ways to get started:

  1. Start with and add to our [example implementation project](https://github.com/PlayFab/Objective_C_SDK/tree/master/ExampleProject).
  2. Import the [Objective-C SDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/Objective_C_SDK/tree/master/PlayFabSDK) into an existing XCode project.

## Configuring PlayFab

Set your PlayFab TitleId in PlayFabSettings.m, on the line:

```objc
  static NSString * TitleId = @"XXXX";
```

## Set up your first API call

The following code example shows you how to make a PlayFab API request and receive the response.

```objc
//EXAMPLE: Login with custom id request:

//Build the Request object:
  LoginWithCustomIDRequest* login_request = [LoginWithCustomIDRequest new];
  login_request.CustomId = [[[UIDevice currentDevice] identifierForVendor] UUIDString]; //use the identifier for vendor as our custom ID.
  login_request.CreateAccount = true; //creates a new account if no existing one
    
//Make each call to [PlayFabClientAPI GetInstance], the first time you do this, an instance will be created and then used.
  [[PlayFabClientAPI GetInstance] LoginWithCustomID:login_request
      
      success:^(LoginResult* result, NSObject* userData) {
        //This block will run when we receive successful response, inspect the result class for pertinent info.
        NSLog(@"error %@",result.PlayFabId);
      }

      failure:^(PlayFabError *error, NSObject *userData) {
        //Request errored or failed to connect, inspect the PlayFabError class for pertinent info.
        NSLog(@"error %@",error.description);
      } withUserData:nil];
```

## Notes

- IDFA/advertisingIdentifier logic is present but has not been properly tested. It is off by default and is only available if you explicitly add USE_IDFA=1 to Target > Build Settings > Preprocessor Macros.

- testTitleData.json is present in the project but must be changed to valid data for any Unit Tests to work.

## Troubleshooting

For a complete list of available APIs, see our [PlayFab API References](../../api-references/index.md) documentation.
