# Game Manager Quickstart

## Let's begin with the basics: Your Developer Account

Before you can call any PlayFab API, you must [have a PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). If you already *have* a PlayFab account, you can skip this step.

![PlayFab - Create your account](media/tutorials/playfab-create-account.png)

Once you have a PlayFab account, navigate to the **PlayFab** home page, [https://playfab.com](https://playfab.com), and log in.

Since PlayFab does not know the name of your game studio or the title of your game, initial values for these fields are assigned. 

- **Unnamed Studio** is the default name of your game studio.

- **Unnamed Title** is the default title of your game, as shown in the following example. You can rename these at any time.

> [!NOTE]
> The Title ID is unique value to your game, which we call a **Title**.  You will use this value when you make PlayFab API calls (your **Title ID** will not be **BCFE**).

![PlayFab - Create a new game](media/tutorials/playfab-create-new-game.png)

Your first title is auto-generated by us.  If you need a new title later, you can create additional titles by selecting **Create a new game** (but don't do this quite yet, please).

The current **Title** and **User** can be found in the top right of your screen. An **Admin** menu will appear when the **User** is selected (please refer to the example provided below).

![PlayFab - Unicorn Battle - Admin Menu](media/tutorials/playfab-unicorn-battle-admin-menu.png)

## Game Manager Sections

Once you have an account, you can select a **Title** (either the one we created, or one of your own) to follow along. Each **Title** has its own **Game Manager**, which covers the following sections:

- **Dashboard** - An overview of the performance of your title.

- **Players** - **Settings** and **Data** pertaining to your individual players, including player segmentation.
- **Economy** - **Settings** and **Data** pertaining to virtual items, stores, currencies and **Loot** distribution, and coupons.
- **Leaderboards** - Configures leaderboard settings, and view current rankings.
- **Multiplayer** - Configures server hosting, and viewing of match records.
- **Content** - Manages the content for your game - including news, remote configuration, and files.
- **Automation** - Features the server-side logic for your game - including scriptings, rules, and tasks. Sets trigger actions, based on the events from your title.
- **Analytics** - Displays reports and event data for your game, and configures how data is routed to other systems.
- **Add-ons** - This is the control center for managing partner integrations.
- **Settings** - Displays the **Settings** and **Data** pertaining to the selected title.
- **Admin** - Contains the **Billing** and **Audit** history.

### Settings

The **Credentials** tab provides basic information that you will use to configure your SDK.

![Game Manager - Settings - Credentials Tab](media/tutorials/game-manager-settings-credentials-tab.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Never share your PlayFab API Secret Key with anyone; doing so may jeopardize the security of your **Title**.

Your Credentials include:

- **Game Title ID**: The unique identifier for your title in the PlayFab system.

- **PlayFab API Endpoint**: The unique base URI for your title. API calls to this endpoint are tracked in your title reports.
- **PlayFab API Secret Key**: The unique identifier for your game when making **Admin** and **Server API** calls. This key should *only* be shared with trusted members of your development team, since it enables API calls that can affect game data and player accounts.
- **Publisher ID**: The unique identifier for your studio.

### Dashboard
   
The Dashboard displays your basic game statistics and **Key Performance Indicators** (**KPI**s). In the top left, you will find filter controls that limit the information displayed:

- **4h**: Will load data generated within the last 4 hours
- **24h**: Will load data generated within the last 24 hours
- **3d**: Will load data generated within the last 3 days
- **7d**: Will load data generated within the last 7 days
- **mtd**: Will load data generated within the current month

You can see data for previous months in the [Reports Section](#reports).

> [!NOTE]
> In Game Manager, all times are displayed in local time.

![Game Manager - Dashboard](media/tutorials/game-manager-dashboard.png)

Monitor your title **KPI**s and watch your **PlayStream** events in real time.

The dashboard has six sections. Left to right, top to bottom they include:

1. **LOGIN**: The number of logins recorded for the selected time-span.

1. **INSTALL**: The number of accounts created (players logging in for the very first time) for the selected time-span.
1. **REVENUE**: The USD value of real-money transactions processed for the selected time-span.
1. **MONTH OVERVIEW**: Useful **KPI**s pulled from the month-to-date data:
    - **Revenue**: The USD value of real-money transactions processed.
    - **DAU (Daily Active Users)**: The average number of unique players logging in per day.
    - **MAU (Monthly Active Users)**: the average number of unique players logging in per month.
1. **PLAYSTREAM DEBUGGER**: Displays the title events as they are generated in real-time.
1. **VIRTUAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS**: The number of virtual currency transactions recorded for the selected time-span.

### PlayStream

This section houses the control panel for everything that is **PlayStream**. Here you will find a graph of the **PlayStream** activity (filtered for the selected time-span). The **Playstream Debugger** (as in other sections) displays **Title** events as they are generated in real-time.

![Game Manager - PlayStream](media/tutorials/game-manager-playstream.png)

Use the sampling controls to gather more or less events per second.

**PlayStream** is our latest and greatest addition to the PlayFab platform. More information will be coming soon on what actions you can do with **PlayStream**.

### Players

The **Players** tab presents you with a sorted list by most recent login. Selecting any of the records will take you to that player's overview. Using the **Search** box you can easily locate players by **ID**, **Username**, **Display Name**, or **email**.

![Game Manager - Players Tab](media/tutorials/game-manager-players-tab.png)

#### Player Overview

This detailed screen provides a wealth of insight into the player's activity. The **Overview** sub-menu contains many links to other player-centric information:

It offers tools your team can use to remedy defrauded players and identify potential abusers.

![Game Manager - Players - Leaderboards](media/tutorials/game-manager-player-leaderboards.png)

Selecting a player name will take you to that player's overview.

The **Leaderboard reset frequency** controls when one **season** begins and another ends. Our **Leaderboards** can optionally to reset themselves **hourly**, **daily**, **weekly** and **monthly**.

### Economy

At the center of PlayFab Economies is the concept of **Catalogs**. 

**Catalogs** are a collection of **items**, **currencies**, **stores**, and **droptables**. This section provides all the tools needed to manage your game's virtual economy.

As an example, the image provided below displaysshows Unicorn Battle's primary catalog.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs.png)

- **Catalog Items** - An item within the catalog. Items can be of several different types.
- **Virtual Currencies** - Arbitrary trackers for the mediums that can be exchanged for **Catalog Items**.
- **Stores**- A subset of **Catalog Items** that can be set to prices that are different than those specified by the **Catalog**.
- **Drop Tables** - Control the item distribution when players open containers and bundles.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs - Edit Container](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs-edit-container.png)

Selecting any **Catalog Item** opens a detailed editor for the item properties.

The example displayed below shows the **Edit Currency** page for the Unicorn Battle's VC called **Hearts**. The settings show that it is being used as a "lives" mechanic that regenerates every hour.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs - Edit Container](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs-edit-container.png)

**Additional Information:**

- [Currencies Tutorial](../../commerce/economy/currencies.md)

### Servers

PlayFab works with many architectures and game types. Whether you are looking to hosting multi-player matches, or just need a secure environment that can reduce many common forms of hacking and abuse.

![Game Manager - Servers - CloudScript](media/tutorials/game-manager-servers-cloudscript.png)

**CloudScript** offers an excellent alternative when compared with the overhead of dedicated game servers.

The servers section of the **Game Manager** has two major roles:

1. The main interface for uploading **CloudScript** files.

1. A control panel for your hosted multiplayer servers.

**Additional Information:**
