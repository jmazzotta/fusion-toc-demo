# Using Prize Tables

This tutorial walks you through how to create a **Prize Table**, that triggers a set of actions, on a group of **Players**, within a range of **Ranks**, in a [Resettable Leaderboard](using-resettable-statistics-and-leaderboards.md). 

In particular, this is a way to trigger **emails**, send **push notifications**, grant [Inventory Items](../../data/playerdata/player-inventory.md) and [Virtual Currency](../../commerce/economy/currencies.md), or execute a [CloudScript](../../automation/cloudscript/writing-custom-cloudscript.md) function at the reset of a **Leaderboard**.

In this example, we show you how to create the **Prize Table End Tournament Prizes** which grants **Virtual Currency** to 5 **Players** based on their rank in a **Leaderboard**, after a reset is performed.

## Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an advanced tutorial. Please make sure that all requirements have been met or you will not be able to complete this tutorial.

- Basic knowledge of how to create a **Player** will be necessary, as there will need to be **Players** in a **Leaderboard** before it can perform any actions on those **Players**. Refer to the [Getting Started with PlayFab - Chapter 1](../../config/dev-test-live/get-started-with-players-and-tournaments.md) tutorial which will run you through the process of creating a **Player** for the **Title**.
- It is also worthwhile to read the [Game Manager quickstart](../../config/gamemanager/quickstart.md) if you are unfamiliar with the **Game Manager**, as it is the place where **Prize Tables** are created.
- In order to use **Prize Tables**, you must have general knowledge of how **Resettable Leaderboards** work. Please read about **Leaderboards** in our tutorial [Using Resettable Statistics and Leaderboards](using-resettable-statistics-and-leaderboards.md).
- Additionally, **Virtual Currencies** must be set up. Please read our tutorial about [Currencies](../../commerce/economy/currencies.md) and set up two currencies with the following parameters:
  - **Currency code**: **GO**
  - **Display name**: **Gold**
  - **Initial deposit**: **200**
  - **Currency code**: **SI**
  - **Display name**: **Silver**
  - **Initial deposit**: **1000**

## Step 1 - Create a leaderboard

In the **Game Manager**:

- Select **Leaderboards** from the menu on the left.
- Select **New Leaderboard**.
- Under the **Leaderboard Properties** area, create a leaderboard called **tournamentScore_manual**.
- Select **Manually** for the **Reset frequency**.
- Select an **Aggregation method** of **Maximum (always use the highest value)**.

![Game Manager - Leaderboards - New Leaderboard](media/tutorials/game-manager-new-leaderboard.png)  

## Step 2 - Create a prize table for the leaderboard

Now that a **Leaderboard** has been created, a **Prize Table** can be associated with it.

- Select **Leaderboards** from the menu on the left.
- Go to the **Prize Tables** tab.
- Select the **NEW PRIZE TABLE** button to be taken to the **New Prize Table** view.

![Game Manager - Leaderboards - Prize Tables](media/tutorials/game-manager-prize-tables.png)  

- In the **New Prize Table** view, fill in the **Name** **End Tournament Prizes**.
- Go the **Leaderboard** area of the screen and choose **tournamentScore_manual** from the **Leaderboard** drop-down menu.

In order for this **Prize Table** to perform some action, **Ranks** will need to be set. To do this:

- Under the **TABLE CONTENTS** section, select the  **+ ADD RANK** button.
- A **Rank** form will appear.

![Game Manager - Leaderboards - New Prize Table](media/tutorials/game-manager-new-prize-table.png)  

In the **Rank** form:

- Verify that the **Rank from** field has a value of **1**.
- Verify that the **To (inclusive)** field has a value of **2**.
- In the **Type** drop-down mnu, choose “Grant virtual currency”.
- In the **Virtual currency code** drop-down menu, choose **GO (Gold)** with an amount of **10**.

![Game Manager - Leaderboards - Prize Table - Add Rank](media/tutorials/game-manager-prize-table-add-rank.png)  

Now, we’ll add a second rank range:

- Select **+ADD RANK** under the **TABLE CONTENTS** section (there is also a second one at the bottom, that also works).
- Verify that the **Rank from** field has a value of **3**.
- Verify that the **To (inclusive)** field has a value of **5**.
- In the **Virtual currency code** drop-down menu, choose **SI (Silver)** with an amount of **10**.

## Step 3 - Populate the leaderboard with a player

A **Leaderboard** and **Prize Table** associated with it has now been created. The next step is to populate the **Leaderboard** with **Players**.

To create players we will be using [LoginWithCustomID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithcustomid) from [Getting Started with PlayFab - Chapter 1](../../config/dev-test-live/get-started-with-players-and-tournaments.md), and then we will use the **Players** to populate the **Leaderboard** with [UpdatePlayerStatistics](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playerdatamanagement.updateplayerstatistics).

Before we can use [UpdatePlayerStatistics](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playerdatamanagement.updateplayerstatistics), we must enable it in **API Features**.

- Select **Settings** in the menu on your left.
- Select the **API Features** tab.
- Check the box for **Allow client to post player statistics**.
- Then select the **SAVE API FEATURES** button at the bottom of the screen.

![Game Manager - Settings - API Features - Allow client to post player statistics](media/tutorials/api-features-allow-client-to-post-player-statistics.png)  

### C# Code Example

The following **C#** code example creates 5 **Players** and logs them in using [LoginWithCustomID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithcustomid).

It then populates the **Leaderboard** you created earlier (**tournamentScore_manual**) with the 5 **Players** with values of: **105**, **104**, **103**, **102**, and **101** using [UpdatePlayerStatistics](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playerdatamanagement.updateplayerstatistics).

```csharp
// Note: This is a recursive function. Invoke it initially with no parameter
public void CreatePlayerAndPopulateLeaderboard(int playerIndex = 5) {
    if (playerIndex <= 0) return;
    const string leaderboardName = "tournamentScore_manual";
    PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithCustomID(new LoginWithCustomIDRequest {
        CustomId = playerIndex.ToString(),
        CreateAccount = true
    }, result => OnLoggedIn(result,playerIndex,leaderboardName), FailureCallback);
}

private void OnLoggedIn(LoginResult loginResult, int playerIndex, string leaderboardName) {
    Debug.Log("Player has successfully logged in with " + loginResult.PlayFabId);
    PlayFabClientAPI.UpdatePlayerStatistics(new UpdatePlayerStatisticsRequest {
        Statistics = new List<StatisticUpdate> {
            new StatisticUpdate {
                StatisticName = leaderboardName,
                Value = playerIndex + 100
            }
        }
    }, result=> OnStatisticsUpdated(result,playerIndex), FailureCallback);
}

private void OnStatisticsUpdated(UpdatePlayerStatisticsResult updateResult, int playerIndex) {
    Debug.Log("Successfully updated player statistic");
    // Recursively invoke for next player
    CreatePlayerAndPopulateLeaderboard(playerIndex - 1);
}

private void FailureCallback(PlayFabError error){
    Debug.LogWarning("Something went wrong with your API call. Here's some debug information:");
    Debug.LogError(error.GenerateErrorReport());
}
```

### Check results of the C# code example

To check that there are 5 **Players** populated in the **Leaderboard** with the correct values:

- Select **Leaderboards**  from your menu on the left.
- Go back to the **Leaderboards** list view.
- Select the **tournamentScore_manual** and there should be 5 **Players** with the values **105**, **104**, **103**, **102**, and **101**.

![Game Manager - Leaderboards - View Leaderboard - Check values](media/tutorials/game-manager-leaderboards-view-leaderboard-check-values.png)  

## Step 4 - Check player’s initial currencies

Before checking anything, go back to the test **Players** from step 2.

- Go to **Players** and find one that was put into **tournamentScore_manual Leaderboard** in step 3.
- Select the **Player ID** and the **Virtual Currency** tab for that player.
- Record the values of the **GO** (**Gold**) and **SI** (**Silver**) currencies for that **Player**.
- Now do this for the remaining 4 of the 5 **Players** that were put in the **tournamentScore_manual Leaderboard** in step 3.
- Make sure that you record the values of their **GO** (**Gold**) and **SI** (**Silver**) currencies (these will be important for confirmation that the **Prize Table** worked after resetting).

![Game Manager - Players - Virtual Currency - Check values](media/tutorials/game-manager-players-virtual-currency-check-values.png)  

## Step 5 - Reset the Leaderboard to grant rewards

Now go to **Leaderboards**.

- Go back to the **Leaderboards** list view.
- Select **tournamentScore_manual**.
- Make a note of the positions of the **Players** on the **Leaderboard** (these are *zero indexed*, so position **0** will be *first place*).

- Select the **RESET NOW** button.
- Select **RESET** button to confirm the reset of the **Leaderboard**
- This will clear the **Players** list.

![Game Manager - Reset Leaderboard](media/tutorials/game-manager-reset-leaderboard.png)

## Step 6 - Test that the Prize Table works

To see if the **Prize Table** worked, the **Players** in the **Leaderboard** can be checked to see if they were granted the correct amounts of currency. This can be quickly seen in a **Player's PlayStream Debugger**.

To see this in the **PlayStream Debugger**:

- Select **Players** from the menu on your left.
- The **PlayStream** tab will show a **Player** ranking on a **Leaderboard** event, followed by a **Virtual Currency** update.

![Game Manager - Players - PlayStream Debugger - Check Leaderboard Events](media/tutorials/game-manager-playstream-debugger-check-leaderboard-events.png)

Now, let's manually check if the **Players** received the correct currencies:

- Select **Players** from the menu on your left.
- On the **Players** tab, move to the **Virtual Currency** area of the screen.
- Verify that the currency was granted correctly.
- This should be *one more* than the amount recorded earlier.
- Notice that **Players** in **Leaderboard** positions **0** or **1** gained **10 gold** with *no silver being awarded*.
- Meanwhile, **Players** in positions **2**, **3**, and **4** were granted **10 silver** and *no gold*.
- This matches the actions set up for the **Prize Table**.

![Game Manager - Player2 - Check Virtual Currency Amount](media/tutorials/game-manager-player2-check-vc-amount.png)

Another way of checking that the **Virtual Currency** was granted correctly is to go into **Players**, and then **Event History**.

This will show a **player_virtual_currency_balance_changed** event with specific details on amounts that changed for the **Virtual Currency** granted.
