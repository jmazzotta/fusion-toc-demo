# Drop Tables

This tutorial shows you the steps fpr creating **Drop Tables** using the PlayFab **Game Manager**. 

**Drop Tables** allow you to randomly generate [inventory items](../../data/playerdata/player-inventory.md), and *sequential* **Drop Tables** can provide some randomness to Player rewards.

## Requirements

- We assume that you are already  familiar with [Catalogs](catalogs.md), [Inventory](../../data/playerdata/player-inventory.md), and [Game Manager](../../config/gamemanager/quickstart.md).  
- You must have a primary **Catalog**, which contains standard, non-**Bundle**/non-**Container** items.
- You must have defined at least one virtual currency which you will use as "free" in-game currency.

You may use your own set of items, but our goal is to create an overlapping categorization of items. As an example, we'll use the following table of items:

|                   | Accessory                 | Armor                | Sword           |
|-------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------------|:----------------|
| **Common**        | Common Accessory          | Common Armor         | Common Sword    |
| **Uncommon**      | Uncommon Accessory        | Uncommon Armor       | Uncommon Sword  |
| **Rare**          | Rare Accessory            | Rare Armor           | Rare Sword      |
| **Legendary**     | Legendary Accessory       | Legendary Armor      | Legendary Sword |

Once you have set up a similar set of items to work with in your **Catalog**, let's build the drop tables.

## Building Drop Tables

**In Game Manager**: 

- Navigate to your **Title**.

- Select **Economy** from the menu on the left.
- Go to the **Catalogs** tab.
- Go to the **Drop Tables** column.

Your screen should be similar to this example.

![Game Manager - Catalogs - Drop Tables](media/tutorials/game-manager-catalogs-drop-tables.png)  

1. Begin building **Drop Tables** on each of your item descriptors.  Our first categorization is **Equipment Type**, so we will create a new **Drop Table** called **Accessories**.

     - Select the **New Drop Table** button.
     - Select **Accessories**.
     - Select **Add Drop Table**.
     - A pop-up should appear.  Select from these items:
        - **Common Accessory**
        - **Uncommon Accessory**
        - **Rare Accessory**
        - **Legendary Accessory**

2. Adjust the weights for the items according to rarity:

     - Common: **1000**
     - Uncommon: **100**
     - Rare: **10**
     - Legendary: **1**

The weights indicate how frequently they should drop in comparison to one another.  For our example shown here, you will drop approximately **1000 Common** 's for every **Legendary**.

3. Save the **Drop Table**.

![Game Manager - Drop Table - Edit Accessories](media/tutorials/game-manager-drop-table-edit-accessories.png)  

With **Accessories** completed, do the same for **Armors** and **Weapons**.

Our other categorization is by **Rarity**, so we'll create an alternate set of tables starting with **Common Equipment**.

1. Select the **New Drop Table** button.
     - Select **Accessories**.
     - Select **Add Drop Table**.
     - A pop-up should appear.  Select from these items:
        - **Common Accessory**
        - **Uncommon Accessory**
        - **Rare Accessory**
        - **Legendary Accessory**

2. Adjust the weights for items according to how the **Common Equipment** options will be in that slot:
     - Common Accessory: **1**
     - Common Armor: **4**
     - Common Sword: **5**

3. Select the **Save Drop Table** button to save your changes.

## Using Drop Tables

You can access **Drop Tables** directly by using one of the two **Server API** methods:

- [GetRandomResultTables](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playeritemmanagement.getrandomresulttables)
- [EvaluateRandomResultTable](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playeritemmanagement.evaluaterandomresulttable)

Using the **Server API** method, you can read the raw **Drop Table** data which we just entered into **Game Manager**.

> [!NOTE]
> It does *not* roll random values or award results. This would let you read the data and parse the information however you see fit.

### Option 1:

```csharp
public void ReadDropTableData() {
    PlayFabServerAPI.GetRandomResultTables(new GetRandomResultTablesRequest() {
        TableIDs = new List<string> { "Accessories", "Common Equipment" }
    }, result => {
        Debug.Log("Complete getting drop tables");
    }, error => {
        Debug.LogError(error.GenerateErrorReport());
    });
}
```

The result handler will receive the structure information we input above, formatted as [GetRandomResultTablesResult](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playeritemmanagement.getrandomresulttables#getrandomresulttablesresult).

Alternately, you can let PlayFab evaluate the table *for* you, and give you a single item result. Doing so returns the **itemId** that can be used to generate a single item, rolled according to the weights provided. 

You can then make a second call which creates the item and gives it to the player.

### Option 2:

```csharp
public void Grant(string playFabId, string tableId) {
    // First, roll a random number and evaluate the drop table
    PlayFabServerAPI.EvaluateRandomResultTable(new EvaluateRandomResultTableRequest()
    {
        TableId = tableId
    }, result => OnRandomResultTableResponse(result, playFabId), OnError);
}

public void OnRandomResultTableResponse(EvaluateRandomResultTableResult tableResult, string playFabId) {
    // Second, take the result and grant it to the player
    PlayFabServerAPI.GrantItemsToUser(new GrantItemsToUserRequest {
        PlayFabId = playFabId,
        ItemIds = new List<string> { tableResult.ResultItemId }
    }, result =>
    {
        // Handle Result
    }, OnError);
}

public void OnError(PlayFabError error) {
    Debug.LogError(error.GenerateErrorReport());
}
```

**Option 1** allows you to load the data once, cache it, and perform the roll yourself on your own game-server. This has lower latency due to fewer calls to PlayFab, and allows you to customize the rolls based on game-specific logic.

**Option 2** lets *PlayFab* do more of the work, but remember - multiple API calls means *higher* latency.

## Advanced Drop Table Usage (Setting up a Loot Crate)

**Drop Tables** can be linked from **Bundles** and **Containers**. **Bundles** are a great option for **Virtual Currency** stores, where a single purchase yields a stack of random items.

For example, let's say we have an 11-item bundle with specific drop rules. In this case, it is a customer-facing selling point that we will guarantee one legendary item. We'll also *restrict* it, so that the player can't get *too* lucky, and receive **11 Legendaries**.

## New Drop Table

and Let's build a **Drop Table** that can literally drop *anything*. We'll actually name it **Anything**, give it *other* **Drop Tables** as its options, and have the appropriate weights.

![Game Manager - New Drop Table](media/tutorials/game-manager-new-drop-table.png)  

At this point, we're done with **Drop Tables**, and we're going to navigate to **Bundles**. In a **Catalog** screen, **Bundles** is in another column next to **Drop Tables**.

![Game Manager - New Catalog Bundle](media/tutorials/game-manager-new-catalog-bundle.png)  

This **Bundle** area uses several features:

- All items of any kind must have an **Item ID**.
- A **Bundle** counts as its own item, and its contents are delivered at the same time it is granted. For this reason, we're making the **Bundle** itself consumable, and it expires 15 seconds after delivery.
- We add different **Drop tables** in different quantities to ensure that **11** items are delivered, but different items roll on different tables.
  - First, we guarantee at least **1 Legendary item**, so the first slot will roll on **Legendary Equipmen**t.
  - The next 3 slots roll on **Anything**, which can roll additional **Legendaries**, or roll crappy common equipment. These rolls will define a *good* roll vs. a *bad* one, as these 3 items can vary wildly.
  - Finally, we fill in the remaining slots with guaranteed **Rares** and **Uncommons**, ensuring that an 11 item roll is not *too* good or bad.

## Conclusion

A **Drop Table** generates a single item randomly from a list of potential items and weights. **Bundles** and **Containers** can be one of the simplest ways to deliver one or more items to a player using **Drop Table**s.

You can manually use a **Drop Table** from a [Custom Game Server](../../multiplayer/compute/custom-game-servers.md) or [CloudScript](../../automation/cloudscript/writing-custom-cloudscript.md), using one of the two **Server API** methods:

- [GetRandomResultTables](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playeritemmanagement.getrandomresulttables)

- [EvaluateRandomResultTable](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playeritemmanagement.evaluaterandomresulttable)
