# Currencies

This tutorial describes the function of the **Currencies** tab in the **Economy** section in **Game Manager**. 

**Virtual Currencies** are the foundation of in-game economies. Players and Characters can be granted these currencies, which can then be used to buy or trade items. Items can have a cost in either a **Virtual Currenc**y or **Real Money**. 

It's *exactly* like real life - except its virtual! Economic regulation in-game is up to *you*.

## What is Virtual Currency?

**Virtual Currencies** provide a medium of exchange for players to purchase virtual items and services from within a title.

Each title can support multiple arbitrary **Virtual Currencies**. This provides flexibility for your game to implement whatever medium of exchange you desire (e.g. **Gold**, **Gems**, **Hearts** or **Interstellar Credits**).

After the initial setup, **Store** and **Catalog** items can now be assigned prices corresponding to the **Virtual Currencies**.

Our **Game Manager** provides tools to make managing your virtual economy straightforward and reliable.

## Field Reference

This section describes each **Field** you see in the **Game Manager Economy Currencies** tab. 

All **Fields** are required - however both **Currency Code** and **Display Name** are not pre-populated with default values. 

Leaving **Recharge Rate** and **Recharge Max** set to **zero** (default) will specify that this currency amount will not auto-regenerate.

### Currency Code

**Currency Code** is a required field. It represents the currency and will be used in the other **Economy** sections.

It *must be* a two-character code and convention is *all upper-case* (although a two-digit number is also allowed).

> [!NOTE]
> **RM** is reserved for **Real Money** and cannot be used as a **Currency Code**.

### Display Name

**Display Name** is a required field. It represents the name that is attached to the currency and that is typically displayed to the user in your game.

The only restriction is that it must be *at least one letter long*. Common examples include **Gold** or **Space Bux**.

### Initial Deposit

**Initial Deposit** represents how much of this virtual currency is given to each player when they first sign-up for a **PlayFab** account. This is often the first time they play your game.

### Recharge Rate (Units/Day)

**Recharge Rate** is an *optional* field. It specifies how much of this **Virtual Currency** is granted to each player per day.

**Virtual Currency** that is granted to the player via a **Recharge Rate** is granted to them gradually, and is evenly distributed over a 24 hour period.

## Example

To create a **Virtual Currency**, you should use the following steps:

1. Select your game in **Game Manager**.
2. Click **Economy**.
3. Click **Currencies**.
4. Click **Add Currency**.
5. Set the **Currency Code**. We'll use **GO** in this example.
6. Set the **Display Name**. We'll use **Gold** in this example.
7. Set the **Initial Deposit**. We'll use **1000** in this example. This gives new players **1,000 units** of this **Virtual Currency** when they start the game.
8. We don't give them any additional **Virtual Currency** every day, so we're done.
9. Select **Save**.
10. Refresh the page.

Your new virtual currency is now added. The greyed out **Currency Code** means your new currency has been saved. 

Don't be confused by the persistent **SAVE** button. It is necessary for subsequent operations on your currency such as deleting or renaming.
