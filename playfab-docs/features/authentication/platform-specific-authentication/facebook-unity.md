# Setting up PlayFab authentication using Facebook and Unity

This tutorial guides you through an example of PlayFab authentication using Facebook and Unity.

## Requirements

- [Unity 5+](https://unity3d.com/) and a created Project
- [Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/) for testing
- [Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/unity/) imported into the project
- Registered [PlayFab](https://playfab.com/) Title
- [PlayFab SDK](https://api.playfab.com/downloads/unity-v2ap) imported into the project with a configured title reference
- Familiarity with [Login basics and Best Practices](../../authentication/platform-specific-authentication/login-basics-best-practices.md)

## Implementation

### Registering a Facebook Application

Start by navigating to the [Facebook Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/):
- Move your mouse over the **My Apps** button **(1)**.
- Select **Add a New App (2)**, as shown on the picture below.

![Facebook add a new app](media/tutorials/facebook-add-a-new-app.png)  

A new application pop-up will open.

- Enter a name for your application **(1)**.
- Enter a contact email **(2)**. 

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to come up with your own *unique* application name and email, as shown on the picture below.

![Facebook new app ID](media/tutorials/facebook-new-app-id.png)  


- Navigate to the **Settings** tab **(1)**.
- Then move to the **Basic** sub-tab **(2)**. 
- Locate your **Application ID (3)**.
- Copy it somewhere to a safe place that is easily accessed. 
We will use it later to set up the Facebook SDK.

![Facebook save app ID](media/tutorials/facebook-save-app-id.png)  

- Navigate to the [Facebook Access Token Tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/accesstoken/).
- Locate your app in the list **(1)**.
- Verify that it has an assigned **User Token (2)**. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you *do not* have an assigned **User Token**, request one using the button to the right of your screen. Refer to this page whenever you need a fresh **User Token**. If authorization fails during testing on a PC, token expiration may be the most likely reason. Refresh the page to get a new User Token and test again.

![Facebook Access Token Tool](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/access-token-tool.png)  

- On your **Application Manager** page, navigate to **+ Add Products (1)**.
- Locate the **Facebook Login** entry and select **Get Started (2)**.

![Facebook login get started](media/tutorials/facebook-html5/login-get-started.png)  

A page with Login product settings should open.

- Make sure that you have the Login product settings page opened **(1)**.
- Verify that both **Client OAuth** and **Web OAuth** are on **(2)**.

### Setting up Facebook SDK

Open your Unity project:

- Select **Facebook** in the file menu **(1)**. 
- Then select **Edit Settings (2)**.

![Edit Facebook Unity project settings](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/edit-project-settings.png)  

The Inspector window will display the current Facebook SDK configuration.

- Enter your Application ID in the corresponding field, as shown in the following picture.

![Enter app ID in Facebook SDK configuration](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/enter-app-id.png)  

### Simple authentication script

Create a new Game Object and rename it to **PlayfabFacebookAuthExample**, as shown in the following picture.

![Create a new Game Object](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/create-game-object.png)  

Create a script called **PlayfabFacebookAuthExample.cs (1)** and add it to the game object **(2)** as shown on the picture below.

![Add example script to game object](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/add-example-script.png)

Inside  **PlayfabFacebookAuthExample.cs** place the following script.

```csharp
// Import statements introduce all the necessary classes for this example.
using Facebook.Unity;
using PlayFab;
using PlayFab.ClientModels;
using UnityEngine;
using LoginResult = PlayFab.ClientModels.LoginResult;

public class PlayfabFacebookAuthExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    // holds the latest message to be displayed on the screen
    private string _message;

    public void Start()
    {
        SetMessage("Initializing Facebook..."); // logs the given message and displays it on the screen using OnGUI method

        // This call is required before any other calls to the Facebook API. We pass in the callback to be invoked once initialization is finished
        FB.Init(OnFacebookInitialized);    
    }

    private void OnFacebookInitialized()
    {
        SetMessage("Logging into Facebook...");

        // Once Facebook SDK is initialized, if we are logged in, we log out to demonstrate the entire authentication cycle.
        if (FB.IsLoggedIn)
            FB.LogOut();

        // We invoke basic login procedure and pass in the callback to process the result
        FB.LogInWithReadPermissions(null, OnFacebookLoggedIn);
    }

    private void OnFacebookLoggedIn(ILoginResult result)
    {
        // If result has no errors, it means we have authenticated in Facebook successfully
        if (result == null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(result.Error))
        {
            SetMessage("Facebook Auth Complete! Access Token: " + AccessToken.CurrentAccessToken.TokenString + "\nLogging into PlayFab...");

            /*
             * We proceed with making a call to PlayFab API. We pass in current Facebook AccessToken and let it create 
             * and account using CreateAccount flag set to true. We also pass the callback for Success and Failure results
             */
            PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithFacebook(new LoginWithFacebookRequest { CreateAccount = true, AccessToken = AccessToken.CurrentAccessToken.TokenString},
                OnPlayfabFacebookAuthComplete, OnPlayfabFacebookAuthFailed);
        }
        else
        {
            // If Facebook authentication failed, we stop the cycle with the message
            SetMessage("Facebook Auth Failed: " + result.Error + "\n" + result.RawResult, true);
        }
    }

    // When processing both results, we just set the message, explaining what's going on.
    private void OnPlayfabFacebookAuthComplete(LoginResult result)
    {
        SetMessage("PlayFab Facebook Auth Complete. Session ticket: " + result.SessionTicket);
    }

    private void OnPlayfabFacebookAuthFailed(PlayFabError error)
    {
        SetMessage("PlayFab Facebook Auth Failed: " + error.GenerateErrorReport(), true);
    }

    public void SetMessage(string message, bool error = false)
    {
        _message = message;
        if (error)
            Debug.LogError(_message);
        else
            Debug.Log(_message);
    }

    public void OnGUI()
    {
        var style = new GUIStyle { fontSize = 40, normal = new GUIStyleState { textColor = Color.white }, alignment = TextAnchor.MiddleCenter, wordWrap = true };
        var area = new Rect(0,0,Screen.width,Screen.height);
        GUI.Label(area, _message,style);
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Running the application in the editor

- Select the play button **(1)**.
- Once Facebook is initialized (and an authentication call is made), a Facebook authentication dialog will appear in your game view.
- Enter the **User Token (2)** and select the **Send Success** button **(3)**, as shown in the following picture.

![Enter user token in Facebook Auth dialog](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/enter-user-token.png)  

- Check the console output. It should render our debug statements, as shown on the picture below. If you see no errors, this means that authentication was successful.

![Debug console output](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/debug-console-output.png)  

### Running the application on Android

Before launching the application on Android, you are required to perform additional configuration steps:

- First, you need to ensure you have the Android platform selected and the unique package ID set (as indicated in the example below. 

> [!NOTE]
> Please make sure to create your own unique package ID.

![Set Android package ID](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/set-android-package-id.png)  

> [!TIP]
> **Optional step**:  Install [Open SSL](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries) and add it to the PATH environment variable. If it is missing, Unity will produce a harmless error during build. This error does not stop the build and does not effect the execution.

Next, in your **Facebook Application** Console:

- Navigate to **Basic** settings **(1)**.
- Select **+ Add Platform (2)**, as indicated in the example provided below.

![Facebook App Console add platform](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/facebook-add-platform.png)  

- Then select **Android** from the list of available platforms.

![Facebook select Android platform](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/select-android-platform.png)  

A panel with platform-specific settings will appear.

- Fill in your **package ID**.
- Select **Save** (the **Save** button is hidden in the bottom right corner of the page).

![Android platform settings](media/tutorials/facebook-unity/android-platform-settings.png)

Build and run the application normally on your Android Device. 

- The application should welcome you with a Facebook Sign In page.
- Once you sign in, watch the message on the screen as it changes.
- Finally, you should be presented with a message indicating successful authentication in PlayFab. The entire procedure is illustrated in the example provided below.
