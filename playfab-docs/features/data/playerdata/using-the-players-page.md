# Using the Players Page

## Monitoring players

It is possible to inspect the players you have in your title using the Players Page. 

- Go to the **Game Manager** page.
- Select **Players** from the menu on the left.
- Select the **Players** tab.

On this page, You can inspect the list of registered players as a table. The table contains general information about the player. You can click a **Player ID** label (blue) to [inspect details about a particular player](player-details.md). You can also use the search query field to look up players.

## Search Techniques

The Search query field consumes two types of queries:

1. **Simplistic**
2. **Complex**

### Simplistic queries

A **Simplistic query** accepts 1 or more tokens separated by a space. It searches through all [player fields](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile#playerprofilemodel),  and looks strictly for one of the tokens. It is possible to use the wildcard symbol **(*)** in the tokens to make the query more flexible.

![Game Manager - Players Page - display names and IDs](media/tutorials/game-manager-players-page-display-names-and-ids.png)  

For example, in the preceding screenshot we chose 2 users:

1. **Lee**
2. **Vicky**

**Display Names** and **IDs** are among the searchable fields, so based only on the information from the screenshot, we have 4 tokens at our disposal:

1. **Lee**
2. **Vicky**
3. **3BB0E45D6CB3304A**
4. **962B724F659A776A**. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Remember - you can use any [searchable player field](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile#playerprofilemodel) as a token.

Now let's test a few querying techniques.

![Game Manager - Players Page - simplistic queries](media/tutorials/game-manager-players-page-simplistic-queries.png)  

1. **Lee** is a value of the **DisplayName** field for one of the players (**Lee**). The search query results in one matching entry.

2. No player has **Vic** as the value of any field.  The search query results in no entries.
3. **3BB0E45D6CB3304A** is the value of the **ID** field for one of the players (**Vicky**). The search query results in one matching entry.
4. **962B724F659A776A** is the value of the **ID** field for one of the players (**Lee**). The search query results in one matching entry.
5. This query involves 2 tokens: **Lee** and **Vicky**. These correspond to the **DisplayName** fields for some of the players (**Lee** and **Vicky**). The search query results in 2 entries.
6. This query involves 2 tokens: **3BB0E45D6CB3304A** and **Lee**. **Vicky** has the **ID** field set to **3BB0E45D6CB3304A**. **Lee** has the **DisplayName** field set to **Lee**. The search query results in 2 entries.
7. The wildcard expression **Vic*** will look for all players with fields set to something starting with **Vic**. The search query results in 3 values.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not the best example, because all three of the located fields are display names. However, if you had a player with an **ID** starting with **Vic**, it would also be part of the query results.

8. The combined strict token **Lee** and wildcard token **Vick*** results in 3 players. One corresponds to **Lee** and 2 others have display names starting with **Vick**.

### Complex queries

**Complex Queries** add more flexibility by introducing field referencing (dot notation, camelCase), operands, grouping using parenthesis, operators AND/OR/NOT and value descriptors.

The basic element of a complex query is a query expression in the format **fieldName:valueDescriptor**. The search engine will then look for all players that have the  specified field (denoted by **fieldName**) with the value (denoted by **valueDescriptor**):

- **fieldName** is a [searchable player field](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.getplayerprofile#playerprofilemodel) in camel case (*DisplayName* becomes *displayName*). It is possible to use dot notation to dig into nested properties: *virtualCurrencyBalances.GM*.

- **valueDescriptor** is obviously something that describes the desired value. It can be a token (**ABC**), a wildcard token (**AB*C**), or a range descriptor (date range value [2016 TO now]).

Let's learn by example.

![Game Manager - Players Page - complex queries](media/tutorials/game-manager-players-page-complex-queries.png)  

1. **displayName:Lee** - Looks for players with the field **DisplayName** set (strictly) to **Lee**. The search query results in 1 entry.

2. **displayName:(NOT Lee)** - Looks for players with the field **DisplayName** set to anything but **Lee**. The search query results in all entries except the player **Lee**.
3. **displayName:(Lee OR Vick** *) - Looks for players with the field **DisplayName** set to either **Lee** or something that starts with **Vick**. The search query results in 3 entries.
4. **playerId:3BB0E45D6CB3304A** or **displayName:Lee** * - Looks for players with the field **DisplayName** set to **Lee** or with the field **PlayerId** set to **3BB0E45D6CB3304A**. The search query results in 2 matching entries.
