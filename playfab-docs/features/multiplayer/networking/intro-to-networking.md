# Introduction to PlayFab Multiplayer Networking and Chat

PlayFab Multiplayer Networking and Chat is a set of libraries and services for easily adding multiplayer real-time networking and chat communication to your game. 

## Concepts

The networking service is oriented around a few key concepts:

- `Network` - A logical representation of a set of interconnected devices participating in a particular multiplayer experience, as well as basic state describing that collection. 
- `Endpoint` - A facility associated with a device that can recieve data from other devices and is the source for sending data to other devices.
- `Network_state_change` - A structure representing a notification to the local device regarding an asynchronous change in some aspect of the network.
- `StartProcessingStateChanges` and `FinishProcessingStateChanges` - The pair of methods called by the app every UI frame to perform asynchronous operations, to retrieve results to be handled in the form of state_change structures, and then to free the associated resources when finished.

At a very high level, the game application uses the  PlayFab networking library to configure a set of users signed-in on the local device to be moved into a PlayFab network. The app calls `StartProcessingStateChanges()` and `FinishProcessingStateChanges()` every UI frame. As app instances on remote devices add their users into a network, every participating instance is provided state_change updates describing the local and remote devices joining that  network. When a player stops participating in the  network (gracefully or due to network connectivity problems), state_change updates are provided to all app instances indicating the user and associated endpoints have  left.

As opposed to a client-server model, a PlayFab network is logically a fully-connected mesh of peer devices. As described in the section of this document, any player can send directly to any other through the API.
