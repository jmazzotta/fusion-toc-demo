# Constructing an Event History Search

This tutorial illustrates how to construct an Event History Search, the components of a search, and how to use Elastic Search syntax in your queries.

Let's start by looking at what we're working towards, a comparison of how much money goes through each payment provider in the most recent week.

![Event History Chart - player-realmoney-purchase](media/tutorials/event-history-chart-player-realmoney-purchase.png)  

Searches are constructed from three fields:

- The **Query** field
- The **Group by** field
- The **Sum by** field

The first field to edit will usually be the **Query** field, which is constructed by selecting an Event Type, a Start Date, and an End Date:

![Event Query - Event Type and Dates](media/tutorials/event-query-event-type-and-dates.png)  

By editing anything within either the Event Type, the Start Date, or the End Date, the **Query** field itself will be constructed:

![Event Query Field - Date range](media/tutorials/event-query-field-date-range.png)  

At this point, the search will result in showing only [player_realmoney_purchase](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/player_realmoney_purchase) events:

By default, **Group by** will aggregate events by their event type. Here, we are only querying for a single event type. Instead, let's group by a property of the event. Looking at the [documentation for the event](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/player_realmoney_purchase), we can see that paymentProvider is a property:

![Event Query - Group by paymentProvider](media/tutorials/event-query-group-by-paymentprovider.png)  

Now, the chart shows the counts of how many events occurred for each group:

![Event History Chart - Group by paymentProvider](media/tutorials/event-history-chart-group-by-paymentprovider.png)  

By default, **Sum by** will count the number of events per group. We can sum a property of the event instead. We could find a property by again looking at the [event documentation](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/player_realmoney_purchase). There is another way to see the properties of the events you query for though: looking at the event JSON itself.

We do this by clicking on the "Show JSON" button to the left of the event:

![Event - Show JSON Button](media/tutorials/event-show-json-button.png)  

Now we can find for a value to compute with. Looking at the JSON, an appropriate value (a number value and not an ID) is "OrderTotal":

![Event - JSON](media/tutorials/event-json.png)  

Let's set the **Sum by** to that value:

![Event Query - Sum by OrderTotal](media/tutorials/event-query-sum-by-ordertotal.png)  

After searching again, we can see that our chart is now what we want:

![Event History Chart - Sum by OrderTotal](media/tutorials/event-history-chart-sum-by-ordertotal.png)  

We could be done here, but there's one issue - If you want to save this search, the dates will still be the week of Aug 25 to Aug 31! We can do better by manually editing the **Query** field.

The constructed **Query** field uses elastic search syntax, meaning that you can use elastic search's features, such as logical operators (note the "AND" between "eventName" and "timestamp") in your queries. Or, what we want here, [date math expressions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/current/date-math-expressions.html).

We can directly substitute the dates in the **Query** field for relative dates:

![Event Query Field - RElative dates](media/tutorials/event-query-field-relative-dates.png)  

Now, if we save the search:

![Event Query Field - Save search](media/tutorials/event-query-field-save-search.png)  

When you select the search from your Saved Searches drop-down, your search will be reconstructed, and when you search, the dates will be relative to the current time.
