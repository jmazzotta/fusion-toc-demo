# Real-time analytics - Events timeline panel

This tutorial illustrates how to use the Events timeline panel.

## Overview

This panel is a subsection of [PlayStream Event History](../../automation/playstream-events/event-history.md) in the form of a table of event data sorted by time. To generate events for testing purposes, see the [PlayStream Quickstart](../../automation/playstream-events/quickstart.md) for examples of how to post custom events.

1. The Timestamp label shows the date and time of the event in a human readable format.
2. The full JSON body of the event. This can be accessed by clicking on the event timestamp.
3. The Player ID. A reference to the player that initiated the event.
4. Event details. At a minimum the details contain an event name, but may contain other useful details.

## Tips

- The **JSON body of the event (2)** is a mix of PlayFab event data and any custom body that is attached to the event when it is posted. You will find all this data stored in one object.
- The **Player ID (3)** may render empty for events that are bound to a title instead of the player.
- You can click the **Player ID (3)** to quickly navigate to the player's personal PlayFab page, where you can obtain more information about the player, their account activities and more.
- You can click the **event name label (4)** to adjust the query to filter the event timeline by that event name.
- If present, you can click the **region label** to open a Google map pointing to the region location.
- Event details may contain several indicators:
  - Region is available when the event body contains location information.
  - Icon is based on the event name.
  - "PlayFab" label indicates that the event is an [automatic event](../../automation/playstream-events/quickstart.md) (generated by PlayFab).
