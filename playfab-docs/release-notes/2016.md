## 161108  

Date: 2016-11-07

**HOTFIX:** Version 1.0 of the overhauled [CSharpSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/CSharpSDK) increased the .Net version requirement from 4.0 to 4.6. This was not intended. This hotfix removes the 4.6 only features, so that it will once again build on .Net 4.0 or higher.

## 161107  

Date: 2016-11-06

**API Changes:**

* **Shared:**
 * CatalogItem
   * InitialLimitedEditionCount ( out of beta )
If IsLImitedEdition is true, then this determines amount of the item initially available. Note that this field is ignored if the catalog item already existed in this catalog, or the field is less than 1.
 * Player display name uniqueness is now optional.
 * Player display name returned as Photon "Nickname" when players connect to Photon Cloud
* **Server API**
 * RedeemCouponRequest
   * Added: CharacterId <br>
Optional identifier for the Character that should receive the item. If null, item is added to the player
* **UpdatePlayerStatisticsRequest**
  * Added: ForceUpdate <br>
Indicates whether the statistics provided should be set, regardless of the aggregation method set on the statistic. Default is false.

**New PlayStream Events:**

* Player_photon_session_authenticated
* Title_secret_key_changed
* Title_api_settings_changed

**SDK Changes:**

* [CSharpSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/CSharpSDK) Specific Changes:
  * [Major CSharp upgrade](https://blog.playfab.com/blog/csharpsdk-upgrade/)

## 161031  

Date: 2016-10-30

~~**Unreal Blueprints hotfix release**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

* ~~UnrealBlueprintSDK **upgrade warning**: There was a naming conflict between Android and the PlayFab "SourceType" enum. As a result, we've had to rename this blueprint-enum.  This breaks any [Client/GetStoreItems](https://api.playfab.com/documentation/Client/method/GetStoreItems) or [Admin/GetStoreItems](https://api.playfab.com/documentation/Admin/method/GetStoreItems) PlayFab-api-nodes. The upgrade process in-editor is to delete and re-create each affected blueprint node.~~

* ~~UnrealBlueprintSDK Specific Changes:~~
  * ~~Fixed a minor bug where certain errors would not report correctly~~
  * ~~Fixed a name conflict that prevented making Android builds (ESourceType)~~

## 161017  

Date: 2016-10-16

**Deprecation Changes:**

* Client/GetUserCombinedInfo has transitioned from Proposed to Deprecated, which means most SDKs using this will now throw an error. Please transition to [Client/GetPlayerCombinedInfo](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.accountmanagement.getplayercombinedinfo)
* Deprecated APIs from this patch note: [160822](#160822) have transitioned from deprecated to obsolete, according to this blog: [Deprecation Visibility](https://playfab.com/blog/deprecation-visibility/) and thus, those APIs have been removed from the newest version of the SDKs. If you update your SDK, you must now transition to the new replacement APIs
* "Password" in [Admin/Models/UserCredentials](https://api.playfab.com/documentation/Admin/datatype/PlayFab.Admin.Models/PlayFab.Admin.Models.UserCredentials) has been deprecated. You no longer need to know your user's password to call [Admin/ResetUsers](https://api.playfab.com/documentation/Admin/method/ResetUsers)

**[UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK) Breaking Changes:**

* If you are using reflection on PlayFab API-model types, you will have to convert your reflection logic from properties to fields (See UnitySdk Specific Changes below)

**API Changes:**

* **New PlayStream events:**
 * [gamelobby_started](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/gamelobby_started),
 * [gamelobby_ended](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/gamelobby_ended)
* [Client/AttributeInstall](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.advertising.attributeinstall) request has deprecated "Android_Id" and converted to "Adid". All SDKs have had some internal login hooks updated to account for this. This is not a breaking change, because it was always intended to use Google-AdvertisingId (Adid), and using the Android DeviceId here would not have worked properly. This change is merely for clarity and consistency
* For the GitHub add-on, revisions to Cloud Script will no longer immediately go live. Instead a new revision will be made, and you make it live via Game Manager
* The default helloWorld Cloud Script function described in this doc: [Cloud Script Quickstart](../features/automation/cloudscript/quickstart.md) was out of date. Updated the document to more closely match the current version (This is only relevant to new title creation)

**API Server Bugfixes:**

* Fixed a 500 error in [Server/ExecuteCloudScript](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.server-sidecloudscript.executecloudscript): PlayFabId is now a mandatory parameter (Formerly it would error if it wasn't provided)
* Fixed a 500 error in [Server/GetSharedGroupData](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.sharedgroupdata.getsharedgroupdata): SharedGroupId is now a mandatory parameter (Formerly it would error if it wasn't provided)
* Fixed a 500 error in [Server/AddSharedGroupMembers](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.sharedgroupdata.addsharedgroupmembers): PlayFabIds is now a mandatory parameter (Formerly it would error if it wasn't provided)
* Fixed a 500 error in [Server/RemoveSharedGroupMembers](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.sharedgroupdata.removesharedgroupmembers): PlayFabIds is now a mandatory parameter (Formerly it would error if it wasn't provided)
* Fixed a 500 error in [Server/DeleteSharedGroup](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.sharedgroupdata.deletesharedgroup): SharedGroupId is now a mandatory parameter (Formerly it would error if it wasn't provided)

**[LuaSdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/LuaSDK) Specific Changes:**

* Better identification headers for Corona vs Defold

**[UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK) Specific Changes:**

* Model properties have been converted to fields so they display better in the Unity Inspector (where relevant)
* Fixed a bug where if a Cloud Script function returns a primitive, it will now be properly deserialized and returned as FunctionResult (Formerly it would have been null)
* The PaperTrail package has been fixed: [UnityPlayFabPaperTrail.unitypackage](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK/blob/master/Packages/UnityPlayFabPaperTrail.unitypackage)

**[SDKGenerator](https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator) Specific Changes:**

* [SDKGenerator](https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator) can additionally read Api-Specs from Api-Server or GitHub, allowing customers to build their custom SDKs in-sync with PlayFab api-server, and with fewer steps and dependencies

## 160912

Date: 2016-09-11

**Unity and CSharp Upgrade Warning:**
* The deprecation warnings described [below](#160822) have gone into effect. Deprecated APIs will now throw compiler errors when possible.
Likewise, the documentation for those APIs have been filtered from the main documentation.

**API Changes:**

* **New APIs:**
  * [Admin/GetAllActionGroups](https://api.playfab.com/documentation/Admin/method/GetAllActionGroups)
  * [Server/GetAllActionGroups](https://api.playfab.com/documentation/Server/method/GetAllActionGroups)

**[LuaSdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/LuaSDK) Specific Changes:**

* Incremental Corona Support: There are new/interim zip-files which can be included in a Corona project. Proper Corona plugins are coming soon.

## 160829  

Date: 2016-08-28

**API Changes:**

* **New APIs:**
  * [Client/GetPlayerTags](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playstream.getplayertags)
  * [Server/AddPlayerTag](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playstream.addplayertag)
  * [Server/GetPlayerTags](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playstream.getplayertags)
  * [Server/RemovePlayerTag](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playstream.removeplayertag)
  * [Admin/AddPlayerTag](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.playstream.addplayertag)
  * [Admin/GetPlayerTags](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.playstream.getplayertags)
  * [Admin/RemovePlayerTag](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.playstream.removeplayertag)
  
We have introduced segment tags, which provide a way of directly putting players into particular segments.
You can now add one or more segment tags to each player. And then, when creating a segment, you can define the segment based on the segment tag.
One intended use for Segment Tags is for integration with external analytics providers, like Appuri. The external analytics provider can perform its own advanced segmentation, like "Likely to Churn", and then set a tag on players that match that segment.
All current deprecation changes have been released. Please see our blog post for details: https://playfab.com/deprecation-visibility/

**[Cocos2d-xSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/Cocos2d-xSDK) Specific Changes:**

* Special thanks to Max Muthig from Forest Ring Games for the following update:
* Added support for lambda callback functions (formerly only static functions were allowed)

**[PostmanCollection](https://github.com/PlayFab/PostmanCollection) Specific Changes:**

* Added a header to all API methods which will help our servers track SDK usage. (This header already exists on all other SDKs)

**[UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK) Specific Changes:**

* We are pleased to announce the initial public beta release of our latest tool: Unity Editor Extensions. This plugin provides an easy-to-use interface for configuring and managing the PlayFab SDK. All Unity developers are encouraged to check out EdEx; There has never been an easier time to sign up and get started developing.
* Added an alternate implementation of ExecuteCloudScript which automatically parses FunctionResult into a target type, using a generic parameter.
* Failure cases in API methods are improved: Some cases that threw exceptions now properly report back to the error-callback (such as Web-Requests with no internet connection), and other cases report better information to the error-callback.

~~**UnrealBlueprintSdk Specific Changes:**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

* ~~Fixed an issue where APIs containing an optional list field in the request would not post the request properly to the server. (Such as GetPlayerStatistics)~~

**[SDKGenerator](https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator) Specific Changes:**

* Updated documentation, and an example project to better document for PlayFab users how to create their own SDKs for our API.

**[UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK) Upgrade Warning:**
* PlayFab.Internal.Util has been renamed to PlayFab.Internal.PlayFabUtil. The "Util" name is very common and exists in the root level for many projects, which causes name conflicts for those customers.
* When updating PlayFab-UnitySdk, you may see some deprecation warnings if you are using PlayFab's implementation of SimpleJson. Please resolve these at your leisure.

**API Changes:**

* **New Admin APIs:**
 * [GetTitleInternalData](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.title-widedatamanagement.gettitleinternaldata)
 * [SetTitleInternalData](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.admin.title-widedatamanagement.settitleinternaldata)
* **New PlayStream events:**
 * [character_consumed_item](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/character_consumed_item)
 * [character_created](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/character_created)
 * [character_inventory_item_added](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/character_inventory_item_added)
 * [character_statistic_changed](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/character_statistic_changed)
 * [character_vc_item_purchased](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/character_vc_item_purchased)
 * [character_virtual_currency_balance_changed](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/character_virtual_currency_balance_changed)
 * [player_redeemed_coupon](https://api.playfab.com/playstream/events/player_redeemed_coupon)

**[UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK) Specific Changes:**

* Known issues: Windows Store apps, and non-IL2CPP build options do not work yet. Stay tuned for a blog post about these issues and our new repository: UnitySDKV2Beta [UPDATE: Old link removed]
* We discovered a name-conflict with the core UnityEngine DLL, specifically an empty namespace called SimpleJson. As such, we've had to rename and reorganize our Json classes... again. Many apologies.

**Global SDK upgrade warning:**
* PlayFabSettings and PlayFabVersion: These files and their contents have been merged into PlayFabSettings.
* If you were previously referencing the PlayFabVersion variables, update to the same/very-similar variable in PlayFabSettings.

**API Changes:**

* **New API:**
 * [SetGameServerInstanceData](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.matchmaking.setgameserverinstancedata)
* **Bugfix for APIs:**
 * [Server/SetGameServerInstanceState](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.matchmaking.setgameserverinstancestate)

**Global SDK upgrade warning:**
For consistency across all sdks, the sdkRevision variable was renamed to sdkVersion ([ActionScriptSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/ActionScriptSDK), [JavaSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/JavaSDK), [UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK))
If you were accessing sdkRevision, switch to sdkVersion.

**API Changes:**

* Some documentation updates, and improved error notifications.

**SDK Global Changes:**

* More steps towards the deprecation of RunCloudScript, so customers should plan to migrate to [ExecuteCloudScript](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.server-sidecloudscript.executecloudscript) for live projects.
* Internally, we are halfway through a push to improve testing multi-platform testing for all sdks. [SDKGenerator](https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator) users may find references to Jenkernaught, and buildIdentifier. Jenkernaught is the code-name for the tech that enables this improved platform testing. buildIdentifier is a new variable in all sdks indicating the specific PlayFab-Jenkins job which generated a particular sdk version.
* There will be blog-post describing what the Jenkernaught does, and more detailed test-framework changes omitted from here, so stay tuned.

**[ActionScriptSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/ActionScriptSDK) Specific Changes:**

* Jenkernaught related ASyncUnitTest framework changes in the example/testing project.

**[CSharpSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/CSharpSDK) Specific Changes:**

* To mirror UnitySDK, we're moving the json-specific code from PlayFabSettings to PlayFabUtil. We've also expanded PlayFabUtil to be closer to feature parity with UnitySDK.

* Minor Jenkernaught related test-changes example/testing project.

**[NodeSDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/NodeSDK) Specific Changes:**

* Added a utility function to the PlayFabClientSDK: IsClientLoggedIn(). Please use this to determine this condition.
* Minor Jenkernaught related test-changes example/testing project.

**[UnitySdk](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnitySDK) Specific Changes:**

* Fixed a critical bug where PlayFab api calls would stop working if you changed scenes.
* Adjusted the defaults for timestamp formats to be consistent with other PlayFab SDKs.
* We are still having issues with Windows-Phone and Windows-Universal for Unity versions 5.3 or higher, which we hope to fix soon.

## 160523  

Date: 2016-05-22

**Global SDK upgrade warning:** Various APIs that save versioned data (UserData, CharacterData, and others) have had a datatype change from int to uint. This will require some users to remove/alter some casting where our api was formerly inconsistent. Some developers may need to change some local variables from int to uint.

~~**UnrealBlueprintSdk upgrade warning:**~~ ~~There was a naming conflict between xcode and some of the playfab enums. As a result, we've had to revise the blueprint-enums again, which breaks all PlayFab-api-nodes using enums. The upgrade process in-editor is to delete and re-create each affected blueprint node (they will throw in-editor-compiler warnings if they're affected).~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

**API Changes:**

* There were some "DataVersion" vars which were set to an inconsistent datatype (int and uint in various apis). All of these have been changed to uint for consistency.
* Some additional options have been added to APIs related to Matchmaking
 * The matchmaker now takes an additional parameter (StartNewIfNoneFound) which allows titles to determine whether a new server should spin up if no results are found in the matchmaking process. By default, StartNewIfNoneFound is true, meaning that a new session will be created if one cannot be found which matches the requirements. This allows titles with skill-based matchmaking to potentially "loosen" the requirements for a match, to get players with skill levels at the far ends of the bell curve into games more quickly.
 * Updated the custom game server logic with GameInstanceState, which determines whether the game session is available for matchmaking. Games which are Closed are not available for matchmaking, allowing developers to create game sessions which are specific to a group of players, as well as to prevent post-start joins of a game session in progress. By default, game servers start in an Open state. New api: [SetGameServerInstanceState](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.matchmaking.setgameserverinstancestate) call can be used by the server to set its state, and StartOpen has been added to the GameModeInfo used in calls to ModifyMatchmakerGameModes, to allow specifying whether sessions in a game mode start as Open (the default) or Closed.

~~**UnrealBlueprintSdk Specific Changes:**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

* ~~Internal SDK updates that make it easier to execute and handle API calls from C++.~~
* ~~Added an internal testing suite which allows thorough verification of PlayFab functionality on all target devices. (Example project only, not the core plugin)~~
* ~~A bunch of C++ code cleanup, and improvements on logging and warnings.~~
* ~~Resolved a concurrency problem with multiple synchronous api calls for Blueprints and C++ calls.~~

## 160502  

Date: 2016-05-01

* Some deprecated and internal fields are no longer published with the SDK: ConfirmationMessege and ForceLink.

~~**UnrealBlueprintSdk Specific Changes:**~~ (UPDATED : This SDK has been deprecated. For the new unreal SDK, please refer to [UnrealMarketplaceSDK](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/playfab-sdk))

* ~~Revised the readme and the example project to use a simpler login process, and the new simpler ExecuteCloudScript method.~~
* ~~When there is an api error, the details of that error will report more accurately and display better debug information.~~
